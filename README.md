## Project Overview

This cloud-based solution for **System Sphere Computers** is built to manage computer products, provide a product catalog for customers, and enable secure online purchases. The app uses **AWS Cloud Services** for **scalability**, **security**, and **cost efficiency**. Developed with **Python** and **Django**, it integrates AWS services like **RDS**, **S3**, **SNS**, **CloudFront**, and **Elastic Beanstalk** for high availability, secure data storage, and rapid scaling.

## Features

### User Features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, and logout using Djangoâ€™s authentication system.
- **Product Catalog**: Allows users to browse products and view details.
- **Shopping Cart**: Customers can add products to their cart and manage quantities.
- **Payment Gateway**: Integrated with **Stripe** for secure payments.
- **Order Confirmation**: Sends email notifications upon successful order placement.
- **Store Locations**: Users can view the nearest stores for in-store purchases.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Admin Features:
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage users, products, and orders from a user-friendly interface.
- **Inventory Management**: Retailers can add, update, or remove products from the catalog.

High level Architecture



The application is designed with a cloud-first approach using **Django** for the backend and **AWS services** for infrastructure. The architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
2. **Backend**: Django-powered REST API for handling business logic.
3. **Database**: **Amazon RDS (MySQL)** for storing user, product, and order data.
4. **Static and Media Files**: Stored in **Amazon S3** for high availability.
5. **Email Notifications**: Handled by **Amazon SNS** for sending email updates to users.
6. **Content Delivery**: Static assets are served globally through **Amazon CloudFront**.
7. **Deployment**: Hosted on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.

## AWS Services Used

- **Amazon RDS (MySQL)**: Managed relational database for storing user, product, and order data.
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for product images, invoices, and static files.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Content Delivery Network (CDN) for low-latency delivery of static assets.
- **Amazon SNS**: Simple Notification Service for sending email notifications to users.
- **Amazon Secrets Manager**: Secure storage for database credentials and API keys.
- **Amazon Elastic Beanstalk**: Hosting service for deploying and managing the application.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging service for application health and performance.
